The following repository contains all files responsible for the recreation and implementation of Sachin Mehta's ESPNet model on BraTS 
Data Sets of year 2018, 2019. The objective in this deep learning project was to classify tumor severity in brain mri across four 
modalities using a convolutional neural network. 
If you wish to acquire these data sets you will need to read the instructions in the Capstone 2 pdfs
or simply search for UPenn BraTS website. Also, you may find the author's github just as insightful. https://github.com/sacmehta/3D-ESPNet
